### What I learned

This was my first time trying Frontend mentor. I love it. This was a simple first dive to see how the challenges work (ie. design/style guides, etc.) This was my first time writing a README.Additionally, i learned the usefulness of "max-content".

```css
.container {
  height: max-content;
}
```
